_Come to class on Jan 31st with the sketch started and we will demo how to submit it together in class_

Take a meaty crop of Julie Mehretu's painting - _A Renegade Excavation_. See Slack for the image. Do not take a crop of the corners! Take a crop from the central area, one that is more dense with a diversity of shapes.

You are to recreate this crop in Processing, using the methods of creating shapes and colors. Your sketch must be 800 by 800 pixels and showcase a variety of shapes, lines, colors, and thicknesses.

I am looking to see how well you understand:

- screen coordinates
- shapes
- creating different shapes in a number of ways - layering, begin/end shape, building shapes with other shapes
- color
- opacity
- layering
- your strategies on creating difficult shapes
- how well your eye sees the many layers of this painting.

Recommendations: Do not do this in one sitting. Take breaks. Work on this in several sessions (and not the night before it's due).

Send me your Mehretu crop via Slack Direct Message.


#### Key aspects:

* Think: density and diversity of shapes. Take up the entire sketch window
* Notice the layering of shapes and how opacity works
* On the https://processing.org/reference/, utilize the listings under: 2D Primitives, Curves, Attributes, Vertex, and Color
* Use a variety of different shapes (at least 7), and different sizes (experiment!)
* Create your own shapes using beginShape(), vertex(), endShape()
* Play with opacity
* When you are playing with opacity, also play with layering shapes on top of one another
* Understanding screen coordinates (where to place the shapes), creating shapes, using color, opacity are key here in building your compositions
* Your sketch size must be 800 x 800 pixels
* Your code must yield the final result. It is not user generated (ie, mouse values, key values) and it is not randomly generated. 


#### Tips:

* [Useful resources for curves (switch tab to playground)](http://yining1023.github.io/p5PlayGround/) 
* [Tutorial on Curves](https://processing.org/tutorials/curves/)
* Drawing out your composition on graph paper first, will help you understand coordinates. Make the top left corner (0, 0)
* Creating an interactive cross-hairs (see example sketches given in class and the Slack channel Code From Class)
